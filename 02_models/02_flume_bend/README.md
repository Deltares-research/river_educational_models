# Flume bend model (Struiksma (1983) flume experiment)
* r001: Input.
* r002: Hydrodynamic project. 
* r003: Hydrodynamic export to DIMR.
* r004: Hydrodynamic with fixed weir. 
* r005: Morphodynamic.
* r006: Spatially-varying sediment availability.
* r007: Tracer sediment. 
* r008: Morphodynamic with fixed weir.
* r009: Morphodynamic with fixed weir at 0.02 mAD.
* r010: Morphodynamic with fixed weir at 0.02 mAD and spatially varying `ACal`.
* r011: Hydrodynamic with calibration factor.
* r012: OpenDA calibration. 

# To do:
* Suspended sediment. 
* 3D suspended sediment.
* Mixed size sediment. 
* negative settling velocity.
